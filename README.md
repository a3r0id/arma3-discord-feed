# Arma 3 Discord Feed

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, move all of the files in `Dependencies/<your operating system>` to the root of your Arma 3 server folder.

## Setup
- Run your Arma 3 server at least once to generate the necessary files then immediately shutdown the server. This is a crucial step to ensure that the extension is bootstrapped correctly.
- Now, you should see a new folder called "arma3-discord-feed" in the root of your Arma 3 server folder. This is the extension's folder.
- You should see a file inside the "arma3-discord-feed" folder called config.json. Open this file and fill in the required fields.
- Start your Arma 3 server and the extension should be running. You can verify this by checking the log files in the extension's folder.
- If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation or reach out to me on Discord: https://isrc.wtf/discord
- Enjoy!
